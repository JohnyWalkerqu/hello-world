Just another repository

Hello Folks,

my name is Nicolas. I am a Newbie in programming. I got in contact with Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. So far I would go to say, that I know some basics. I am looking forward to get more knowledge about building a Website and learning more about creating useful stuff.

Best,
Nicolas
